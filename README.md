# Tutorial - Docker Term Paper
## What is Docker?
Docker is an open platform for developing, installing, and running applications. You may divide your apps from your infrastructure using Docker, which speeds up software delivery. You can use Docker to manage your infrastructure in the same ways that you do to your applications. You may significantly shorten the time between developing code and having it run in production by using the Docker's methodology for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly. Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers :
  
* Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.
* The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.
* When youâ€™re ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two.
