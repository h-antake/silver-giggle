# What is docker?
Docker is an open platform for developing, installing, and running applications. You may divide your apps from your infrastructure using Docker, which speeds up software delivery. You can use Docker to manage your infrastructure in the same ways that you do to your applications. You may significantly shorten the time between developing code and having it run in production by using the Docker's methodology for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly.
